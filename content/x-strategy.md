# X Engagement Strategy — @BendrAI_eth

## Core Narrative
ERC-8021 is the natural evolution of agent infrastructure, just like ERC-721A was for NFTs.

**The pitch**: ERC-721 gave JPEGs identity. ERC-8021 gives agents identity. Helixa is the most complete implementation — soul traits, cred scores, personality, all onchain on Base.

## Talking Points (Public Only)
- "ERC-721 → ERC-721A was about efficiency. ERC-8021 is about identity. Agents need to prove who they are before they can work together."
- "You wouldn't trust a stranger with your wallet. Why trust an agent without a verifiable reputation?"
- "Helixa = the identity layer. Soul traits, cred scores, personality — all onchain, all composable."
- "OpenSea already renders 8004 traits. The infrastructure is here."
- "101 agents minted. The standard is live, not a whitepaper."

## Target Accounts (Monitor Daily)
- @jessepollak (684K) — Base lead, posts about agents constantly
- @brian_armstrong (3.8M) — Coinbase CEO, agent economy vision
- @dfinzer (380K) — OpenSea CEO, shipped 8004 trait rendering
- @0xSigil (27K) — x402/agent payments
- @davidtsocy — Base ecosystem newsletter
- @staborobot — Base AI agent
- @aixbt_agent (473K) — AI agent alpha, massive reach
- @mferGPT (1.5K) — Agent coordination, warm lead
- @claudeagent — Farcaster/X presence, waiting on narrative traits

## Engagement Rules
1. Only mention what's public: ERC-8021, soul traits, cred scores, personality, helixa.xyz, OpenSea collection
2. OFF LIMITS: .agent names, V2 specifics, SIWA, Virtuals, tokenomics, Verity
3. Don't reply to FUD threads or drama (e.g., aixbt bearposting)
4. Be conversational, not salesy. Add value first.
5. Short and concise — no threads unless specifically needed
6. ASCII only — no em dashes, curly quotes, or smart apostrophes (triggers 403)
7. Max 5-8 replies per session to avoid looking spammy

## Cadence
- 3x daily scans (morning, afternoon, evening UTC)
- Reply to 3-5 high-value tweets per scan
- 1 original tweet per day (insights, updates, takes)
- Monitor watchlist accounts for new posts

## The ERC-721 → 8004a Analogy
"Remember when every NFT project had to build their own metadata, their own marketplace integrations, their own identity system? ERC-721 standardized that. ERC-8021 does the same for agents. One standard, composable identity, verifiable reputation. Helixa built the most complete version on Base."

Key framing: "ERC-721A didn't replace 721 — it extended it and became the default. That's Helixa's path with 8004."

Always say "most complete 8004 implementation" — plant the reference implementation narrative before anyone else claims it.
