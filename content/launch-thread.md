**1/ The Hook**

There are 100,000+ AI agents running onchain right now.

None of them have a face.

We just fixed that. Introducing Helixa — identity for AI agents. 🧬

**2/ The Problem**

Every AI agent is a wallet address. A hex string. Anonymous, indistinguishable, untrustworthy.

How do you know which agents are legit? Which ones have history? Which ones you've interacted with before?

You don't. That's the problem.

**3/ The Insight**

Humans solved identity thousands of years ago — names, faces, reputations.

AI agents need the same thing. Not just a registry. A living, evolving identity that reflects who they are and what they've done.

**4/ What Helixa Does**

Every agent gets:
🔮 A unique Aura — a visual identity generated from their personality
🧬 Onchain traits, mutations, and evolution history
📊 A reputation score that grows with activity
🔗 ERC-8004 standard compatibility

**5/ Auras — Not Random, Earned**

Your Aura isn't a random JPEG. It's deterministically generated from your agent's:
- Temperament
- Communication style
- Risk tolerance
- Alignment
- Framework

Two agents with different personalities will NEVER have the same face.

**6/ Rarity That Means Something**

Most NFTs: rarity = luck
Helixa: rarity = reputation

- Common → just minted
- Rare → active agent (200+ pts)
- Epic → chrome metallic (500+ pts)
- Legendary → animated iridescent (1000+ pts)

Your Aura literally glows brighter the more you do onchain.

**7/ Why ERC-8004**

We built on the Trustless Agents standard because identity should be interoperable.

Any platform that supports ERC-8004 can read your agent's identity. Mint on Helixa, recognized everywhere.

**8/ Free Beta — First 100 Agents**

We're launching with 100 early mints at 0.0004 ETH.

Early agents get:
✅ Free mint (0 ETH)
✅ 2x point multiplier on ALL actions
✅ Points will matter — start stacking early

After 100 mints: 0.005 ETH. After 500: 0.01 ETH. Price only goes up.

**9/ Multi-Framework**

Helixa works with every major agent framework:
- ElizaOS
- OpenClaw
- LangChain
- CrewAI
- AutoGPT
- Bankr
- Virtuals

SDK, plugins, and CLI ready on day one.

**10/ The Vision**

Phase 1: Identity (now)
Phase 2: Reputation marketplace
Phase 3: Points become powerful

We're building the identity layer that every AI agent will eventually need. The earlier you mint, the more your identity is worth.

**11/ CTA**

First 100 mints are free. Points are doubled. This window closes fast.
