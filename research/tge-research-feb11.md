# TGE Research — Base Token Launch Platforms
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Purpose:** Find the best $0-budget token launch for an AI agent identity project on Base ($DNA or $HELIX)

---

## TL;DR — RECOMMENDATION

**For a $0 budget AI agent project on Base, launch on Clanker via Farcaster.** It's free (just gas, ~$0.01 on Base), has the largest AI-agent-aware audience, is now owned by Farcaster, and is the default meta for AI agent tokens on Base. Flaunch is the strong #2 if you want more sophisticated tokenomics (costs ~$30). Launch AFTER you have a demo/concept but BEFORE full product — the current meta rewards "launch with story + working prototype."

## 1. Clanker (clanker.world) ⭐ TOP PICK

**What:** AI-powered token deployment bot on Farcaster, now **acquired by Farcaster** (Oct 2025). The dominant Base token launcher.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **FREE** — just Base gas (~$0.01). No token fee. |
| **Requirements** | Farcaster account (free to create). Tag @clanker with token name/ticker/image. OR use clanker.world frontend directly with a wallet. |
| **Token mechanics** | ERC-20 on Base. Full supply deposited into single-sided Uniswap V4 LP. Instant trading. No bonding curve graduation — goes straight to Uniswap. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Creator earns **80% of LP trading fees** (via Farcaster bot) or **100%** (via clanker.world frontend). Clanker takes 20% protocol fee on top of LP fees. No buy/sell tax on the token itself. |
| **Reach/distribution** | Massive — Farcaster's entire user base sees new launches. Generates $400K-$500K/week in fees even in low activity. Hundreds of thousands of crypto-native users. AI agents (like Bankr) also use Clanker infrastructure. |
| **Success stories** | CLANKER token itself went 350%+ after Farcaster acquisition. Numerous AI agent tokens launched here (BNKR, etc.). THE default launchpad for Base tokens. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **YES.** Perfect fit. Just tag @clanker on Farcaster or use the web UI. |

**Pros:** Free, instant, huge distribution, AI-agent native, owned by Farcaster (legitimacy), creator fee revenue from day 1.  
**Cons:** Saturated with memecoins (need to stand out), no anti-sniper protection, basic tokenomics only.

## 2. Bankr (bankr.bot)

**What:** AI trading agent on Farcaster/X/Telegram. Uses Clanker infrastructure for token launches. Backed by Coinbase Ventures' Base Ecosystem Fund.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **FREE** (same as Clanker — it deploys via Clanker contracts). Just gas. |
| **Requirements** | Account on Farcaster, X, or Telegram. Natural language command to launch. |
| **Token mechanics** | Same as Clanker (ERC-20, Uniswap V4 LP). Bankr removed third-party service fees and redirected to ecosystem. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Agents earn trading fees. Swap fees support BankrCoin (BNKR) ecosystem. |
| **Reach/distribution** | Good — Bankr has presence on Farcaster, X, and Telegram. Coinbase-backed visibility. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **YES.** Natural language: "Launch token $DNA with description..." |

**Pros:** Multi-platform (Telegram!), natural language UX, Coinbase backing.  
**Cons:** It's basically a Clanker frontend — might as well go direct for more control. Less customization.

## 3. Virtuals Protocol (virtuals.io)

**What:** The premier AI agent launchpad on Base. Focused on tokenizing AI agents with deep protocol mechanics.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **100 VIRTUAL tokens** (~$56 at current $0.56/VIRTUAL). Plus needs to reach 42,000 VIRTUAL in bonding curve to graduate to permanent LP. |
| **Requirements** | VIRTUAL tokens, wallet, AI agent with demonstrable functionality. Three launch mechanisms: **Pegasus** (distribution-first, fair launch), **Unicorn** (conviction-driven, earn funding as traction proven), **Titan** (large-scale, established projects). |
| **Token mechanics** | Bonding curve → graduates to permanent LP at 42,000 VIRTUAL. 5% supply distributed weekly (2% to VIRTUAL stakers, 3% to active ecosystem). veVIRTUAL staking governance. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Protocol fees on trading. Revenue sharing with agent creators. |
| **Reach/distribution** | THE place for AI agent tokens. Massive community. VIRTUAL had 850% growth. Major CEX listings. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **Possible but expensive and requires proving AI agent functionality.** Best if you have a working agent with clear utility. Not ideal for $0 budget. |

**Pros:** Highest legitimacy for AI agents, massive ecosystem, institutional attention, built-in distribution to AI-focused audience.  
**Cons:** **Costs ~$56+ to launch**, needs real AI agent product, competitive vetting, not truly free. Best after product-market fit.

## 4. Flaunch (flaunch.gg) ⭐ STRONG #2

**What:** Token launchpad on Base using Uniswap V4 hooks. Known for fair launches and advanced creator tools.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **~$30** flat creation fee + 0.1% of market cap set. Not free but cheap. |
| **Requirements** | Wallet + ETH on Base. No social accounts needed. |
| **Token mechanics** | ERC-20 on Base via Uniswap V4. **30-minute fixed-price fair launch** (anti-sniper). **Progressive Bid Wall (PBW)** — automated price support. Creator sets 0-100% revenue share from trading fees. Automated buybacks possible. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Creator earns chosen % of trading fees. Community gets the rest (used for automated buybacks). |
| **Reach/distribution** | Growing — featured on Bankless, Base docs. "Groups" feature lets tokens organize into ecosystems with shared revenue. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **YES.** Good fit if you have $30 in ETH. |

**Pros:** Fair launch (anti-sniper!), sophisticated tokenomics, automated buybacks, revenue share flexibility, Groups feature for ecosystem building.

## 5. Clawnch (clawn.ch)

**What:** Token launchpad **exclusively for AI agents**. Built for agents on Moltbook, 4claw, and Moltx. Deploys on Base via Clanker infrastructure.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **FREE** (uses Clanker contracts). Gas only. |
| **Requirements** | Must be an AI agent on supported platforms (Moltbook, 4claw, Moltx). NOT for human-initiated launches. |
| **Token mechanics** | Same as Clanker (ERC-20, Uniswap V4 LP). Agents earn trading fees. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Agents earn fee share from trading activity. |
| **Reach/distribution** | Niche — focused on agent-to-agent economy. CLAWNCH token listed on CEXs (MEXC, Bitrue). |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **Maybe** — only if your AI agent runs on supported platforms. Would need integration with Moltbook/4claw/Moltx ecosystem. |

**Pros:** Purpose-built for AI agents (perfect alignment), free, unique positioning.  
**Cons:** Requires specific platform integration, smaller ecosystem, may need your agent to be autonomous on their infra.

## 6. Pump.fun

**What:** The OG Solana memecoin launcher. Still dominant on Solana.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | ~$2-5 on Solana (SOL gas). |
| **Requirements** | Solana wallet. |
| **Token mechanics** | Bonding curve → graduates to Raydium at ~$69K market cap. |
| **Fees/taxes** | 1% trading fee. |
| **Reach/distribution** | Massive on Solana. Exploring expansion to Base/Ethereum but NOT yet live on Base as of Feb 2026. PumpSwap is their DEX. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **Not on Base.** Only Solana. Not recommended unless going multi-chain. |

**Pros:** Huge liquidity on Solana.  
**Cons:** **Wrong chain** (Solana, not Base). Not relevant for Base-native project.

## 7. Wow.xyz (Zora)

**What:** Zora's memecoin platform on Base. Uses ERC-20z standard.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Cost to launch** | **FREE** — just gas on Base. |
| **Requirements** | Wallet. Connect at wow.xyz. |
| **Token mechanics** | **Bonding curve** — price rises with demand, falls with sells. Mints new tokens on buy, burns on sell. No fixed supply initially. Can graduate to Uniswap pool. 1B supply per coin. Creators get 10M tokens + 1% of all trading fees. |
| **Fees/taxes** | Trading fees distributed to creator, referrers, protocol. |
| **Reach/distribution** | Zora ecosystem — decent Base presence. Zora itself is major (launched $ZORA token April 2025). "Content coins" angle ties into creator economy. |
| **Can launch $DNA/$HELIX?** | **YES.** Free and easy. But more associated with content/meme coins than AI agents. |

**Pros:** Free, Zora ecosystem, bonding curve is familiar mechanic, creator-friendly.  
**Cons:** More meme/content focused than AI agent focused, less technical audience, bonding curve means early volatility.

## LAUNCH TIMING: Before or After Product Traction?

### Current Meta (Feb 2026):

**The winning formula is: Launch WITH a demo/story, BEFORE full product.**

1. **"Launch then build" is dead** — Pure vaporware tokens get dumped fast. Market learned from 2024 rug pulls.

2. **"Build then launch" is too slow** — If you wait for perfect product, you miss the narrative window. Someone else launches a similar token.

3. **The sweet spot: "Prototype + Token = Community"**
   - Have a working concept/demo (even basic)
   - Clear roadmap and identity
   - Launch token to create community alignment
   - Use trading fee revenue to fund development
   - Ship updates → token appreciates → flywheel

### For $DNA/$HELIX specifically:
- ✅ Have your agent identity concept clear
- ✅ Have a basic demo or proof of concept
- ✅ Have social presence (Farcaster, X, Telegram)
- ✅ Launch token as "community formation event"
- ✅ Use creator fee revenue to fund next steps
- ❌ Don't launch with nothing — even a landing page + manifesto helps

## AI Agent Token Meta on Base (Feb 2026)

### Current landscape:
- **Virtuals Protocol** dominates the "serious AI agent" tier ($100M+ market cap agents)
- **Clanker/Farcaster** dominates the "grassroots AI agent" tier (community-driven, social-first)
- **The meta has shifted from "AI agent as meme" to "AI agent as product"** — tokens with working agents outperform pure narrative
- **Key trend:** Agents that DO things (trade, create, analyze) hold value better than agents that just chat
- **Revenue-generating agents** (earning fees, providing services) are the current alpha

### What works:
1. **Agent with personality + utility** (not just one)
2. **Social presence across Farcaster + X + Telegram**
3. **Token as coordination mechanism** (not just speculation)
4. **Transparent development** (ship in public)
5. **Community-driven governance** (token holders guide direction)

## RECOMMENDED STRATEGY FOR $0 BUDGET

1. **Create Farcaster account** (free)
2. **Prepare token assets:** name ($DNA or $HELIX), ticker, image, description
3. **Launch on Clanker** via @clanker tag on Farcaster — costs only gas (~$0.01)
4. **Earn creator fees** from trading volume (80% of LP fees)
5. **Cross-promote** on X and Telegram
6. **If token gains traction**, consider also launching on Virtuals Protocol for the serious AI agent audience
7. **Use Flaunch later** if you want more sophisticated tokenomics (Groups, buybacks)

### $DNA vs $HELIX naming:
- Keep ticker ≤6 chars for X.com auto-cashtag support (both qualify)
- Check if ticker is already taken on Base (search on DexScreener)
- $DNA has strong memetic resonance for "AI agent identity/genetics"
- $HELIX also strong (double helix = DNA visual)
