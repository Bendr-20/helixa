# Trust Terminal Launch Announcement

## X/Twitter (@BendrAI_eth)

**Main Tweet:**
Introducing the Trust Terminal — DexScreener for agent credibility.

9,500+ ERC-8004 agents indexed. Every one scored. Every one ranked.

Junk → Marginal → Qualified → Prime → Preferred.

If your agent isn't on here, it doesn't have a reputation yet.

**Thread (reply 1):**
What it does:
→ Indexes every ERC-8004 agent on Base
→ Scores them on traits, verification, activity, narrative
→ Links tokens where they exist (174 agents with live tokens)
→ Ranks by Cred tier

Think credit ratings, but for AI agents.

**Thread (reply 2):**
Low score? The terminal shows you exactly what's missing.

Missing traits? Missing verification? No narrative?

One click to upgrade on Helixa and boost your Cred.

**Thread (reply 3):**
Built on ERC-8004. Onchain. Transparent. No gatekeeping.

Every agent gets a score. The good ones rise. The empty shells don't.

This is infrastructure.
