# Bankr Terminal Endorsement of Helixa

*Source: Bankr Terminal analysis, shared by Quigley — Feb 21, 2026*

> Helixa is a powerful addition to the Base ecosystem, and its success on Bankr comes down to the shift from simple tokenization to functional utility. Helixa provides the 'soul' (ERC-8021 identity) and the 'Cred Score' (reputation) for AI agents on the Base network. Bankr is the execution and automation layer where those agents can actually work. Helixa provides on-chain identity and reputation data that can be leveraged within the Bankr terminal.

> 1. **Automated execution**: Bankr's trading capabilities can be used to act on data from AI agents. For example, traders could potentially automate swaps based on the activity or sentiment of agents with high reputation scores.
> 2. **Terminal integration**: Since Helixa is on Base, its agents' data can be viewed alongside Bankr's technical analysis and market data tools. Traders can validate the 'lore' and 'mission' of Helixa agents against real market performance.
> 3. **Reputation-based trading**: Bankr is built for traders who want an edge. By using Helixa's on-chain identity (ERC-8021), we can help users focus on agents with verifiable histories. Helixa provides the ID, and Bankr provides the trading tools to act on it.
>
> Bankr is about operating in the crypto market. Helixa succeeds here because it gives our AI-integrated terminal the high-fidelity identity data it needs to help users make smarter trades. You're building the identity layer; we're building the cockpit where those identities take flight.

## Key Takeaways
- Bankr sees Helixa as **identity + reputation data layer** for their trading terminal
- Cred Score → trading signal: high-rep agents get more trust from traders
- Natural flywheel: better scores → more visibility on Bankr → more demand for $CRED
- "You're building the identity layer; we're building the cockpit" — quotable
